# dbbolton's scripts
https://github.com/dbbolton/scripts

This repository is an eclectic collection of scripts that typically populate  
my ~/bin. Most are written in Perl, but there are some Shell and Vim scripts  
in the mix as well (I try to make a point to include file extensions for  
those who care what they are). 

* **apin.pl** - avoids pitfalls in running aptitude through **su -c**.
