# dbbolton's scripts
https://github.com/dbbolton/scripts

This repository is an eclectic collection of scripts that typically populate  
my ~/bin. Most are written in Perl, but there are some Shell and Vim scripts  
in the mix as well (I try to make a point to include file extensions for  
those who care what they are). 

* **apin.pl** - avoids pitfalls in running aptitude through **su -c**.  

* **apt-carbon.pl** - generates a shell script to duplicate a Debian system  
                      easily.

* **cpu-gov.pl** - decides which CPU governor and implements it based on power  
                   source.  

* **dwn-status.pl** - provides several functions for displaying system info  
                      in the dwm "status bar"; add this script to your  
                      **~/.xinitrc** before dwm.  
  
* **file-rename.pl** - sensibly renames files with problematic characters.  
  
* **forkbomb.pl** - is an example of obfuscated perl code. Doesn't work.
