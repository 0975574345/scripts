# dbbolton's scripts
https://github.com/dbbolton/scripts

This repository is an eclectic collection of scripts that typically populate  
my ~/bin. Most are written in Perl, but there are some Shell and Vim scripts  
in the mix as well (I try to make a point to include file extensions for  
those who care what they are).  

* **apin.pl** - avoids pitfalls in running aptitude through **su -c**.  

* **apt-carbon.pl** - generates a shell script to duplicate a Debian system  
easily.

* **cpu-gov.pl** - decides which CPU governor and implements it based on power  
source.  

* **dwn-status.pl** - provides several functions for displaying system info  
in the dwm "status bar"; add this script to your  
**~/.xinitrc** before dwm.  
  
* **file-rename.pl** - sensibly renames files with problematic characters.  
  
* **forkbomb.pl** - is an example of obfuscated perl code. Doesn't work.  

* **ipad.pl** - shows your interface's IP address and your external address.  

* **kernel-deb.sh** - saves typing durning the kernel build process.

* **ladj.pl** - helps in generating Wiktionary entries for first declension  
Latin adjectives.  

* **media-sync.pl** - eases my rsync procedure.

* **nvidia-installer.pl** - offers choice of available versions and automates  
installation of **nvidia** Xorg drivers from the Debian repos; also offers  
choice of available Nvidia binary installers and can store default args.
